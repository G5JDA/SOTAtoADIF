# SOTAtoADIF v1.0.0-alpha1

Convert SOTA database CSV logs to ADIF. Including enrichment from SOTA API summit data.

Designed for `Python >= 3.10.0, urllib3 >= 2.0.0`.

Specifically intended to produce ADIF files that can be easily uploaded to LoTW using TQSL.
Contrary to what many people seem to believe, **you do not need a station location in TQSL for every single summit!**
As long as you have not changed the default TQSL settings, the locator from the ADIF QSO will be used.
The remaining caveat is your callsign must imply the DXCC entity you operated from.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/G5JDA/SOTAtoADIF/wiki) for important guidance on use with LoTW / TQSL ‚ö†Ô∏è

## TODO for v1.0.0 release
- [ ] Add detail of how to use with TQSL to Wiki
- [ ] Make big disclaimer / notice that callsign must = single DXCC 
(and CQ/ITU zones but these can be set to NONE if not) otherwise not acceptable for LoTW upload.
  - [ ] maybe also make CLI prompt to agree to this caveat
  - [ ] technically possible to set DXCC to NONE also but then no point uploading to LoTW surely?
- [ ] linux install script: venv creation script + pip install requirements.txt (python>=3.10, urllib3>=2)
- [ ] linux update script: check for git changes on main, pull, rebuild venv etc
- [ ] Bump version number
- [ ] Pyinstaller exe for windows

## Ideas / Thoughts

- `Target >= v1.1.0`
  - `--ignore-before (-i) [date]` option.
    - Allow users to input full log csv but ignore records before specified date.
    - Otherwise, full log processing and single activation processing are easy, anything inbetween is clumsy.
    - Not so useful for LoTW - TQSL already allows date range selection during import.
  - `--merge-suffixes (-m)` option.
    - Optionally output an additional ADIF file for each base callsign (e.g. G5JDA) that strips callsign suffixes.
    - E.g. all `/P` and `/M` QSOs but without the suffix.
    - In this way, users have the option of additionally logging without a suffix
    (and since we only merge suffixed QSOs we don't have dupe issues with the plain callsign ADIF file).
    - This is needed because a lot of stations don't log suffixes properly ([LoTW quietly recommends this](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/submitting-qsos/)).
- `Target >= v2.0.0`
  - `--s2s` Optional import of S2S CSV, then do some kind of join if all other fields of QSO match, add DX SOTA ref.
    - This has no utility for LoTW so do not include in version 1.
    - Big utility for getting most info from csv into adif - e.g. to import to logging program.
  - `-c` Chaser CSV could also be added (not for S2S but will include them without my SOTA ref - a join with S2S could exclude them).
    - Would be better than nothing for adding to logging programs / LoTW for DXCC, but it will be impossible to guess the locator.
    Not an issue for LoTW as long as the station location has blank locator field (docs suggest this is possible, and how 
    LoTW copes with airborne contacts). I guess the user could use their home QTH if they are sure all contacts are from 
    there. Not much gain over ON6ZQ, but I guess worth adding for completeness in version > 1.

## Getting Started / How to Use

### Windows

If you know what you're doing with Python on Windows, adapt the Linux guide below.
Otherwise, follow this guide for the simplest approach - note you will only be able to run released versions
(not development or experimental branches). 
If you want to try out upcoming features, or modify the source code, you will have to sacrifice the easy life!

To make your life easy, when releasing a new version of SOTAtoADIF, I use `pyinstaller` to produce a windows `.exe`.
This way you don't need to worry about installing Python or managing a virtual environment.


#### Prerequisites

- An internet connection (both for initial download and use - calls are made to the SOTA API)
- A copy of the latest released `SOTAtoADIF-v*.exe`
  - Download this from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/G5JDA/SOTAtoADIF/releases) (**look in 'Assets' under the newest release**).

#### Use

Open PowerShell (or cmd if you really want).
```shell
# go the directory where you placed the released SOTAtoADIF-v*.exe
cd \path_to_directory_with_exe\

# run SOTAtoADIF (make sure to replace * to match the real filename)
.\SOTAtoADIF-v*.exe <SOTA Database CSV filepath>

# see what options exist
.\SOTAtoADIF-v*.exe -h
```

### Linux

If you are proficient in using Linux, this is probably easier than Windows...

#### Prerequisites

- An internet connection (both for initial download and use - calls are made to the SOTA API).
- `git` - if not present, install with your package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install git`).
- `Python >= 3.10.0` - we will set up a venv.
- `urllib3 >= 2.0.0` - will be automatically installed with our venv creation script.

#### Install
This is linux, we're not really installing a Python script üòâ!

However, these steps only need to be followed the first time.
```shell
# clone the repository (no need to grab a specific tag, main branch will be the latest release)
git clone https://github.com/G5JDA/SOTAtoADIF.git

#TODO venv creation script & run here
```

#### Use

Do this each time you want to use SOTAtoADIF.

```shell
# make sure you are in the SOTAtoADIF directory
cd /<path_to>/SOTAtoADIF

# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# run SOTAtoADIF
python3 SOTAtoADIF.py <SOTA Database CSV filepath>

# see what options exist
python3 SOTAtoADIF.py --help
```

#### Update

If it has been a while since you last used SOTAtoADIF, there may be a newer version available.

```shell
# make sure you are in the SOTAtoADIF directory
cd /<path_to>/SOTAtoADIF

# get latest changes
#TODO run update script (determines if there are new changes on main, if so pull & rebuild venv)
```


### Mac
If you have a Mac, please feel free to contribute a basic how to use guide.

The steps should be somewhat similar to Linux except you might not already have Python `>=3.10`.

## Contributing

Essential:
- Develop for Python 3.10.
- Avoid non-standard imports unless you have an undeniable reason:
  - Yes, even if the package can be installed with pip!
  - This is to save ourselves from future dependency chaos.
  - `urllib3` is the only exception so far due to the massive time saving it produces.
- Obey the style guide in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)


**If you'd like to contribute a new feature, be sure to create an issue offering to do so first.**
This will likely save much back and forth when compared to surprise PRs!

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on code
of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests.

### Installing for Development

#### Linux
1. Fork and git clone this repository to your development machine (do not just download the source zip!!).
2. Follow the `venv` setup instructions for normal users (there are no special requirements for development).

#### Windows
1. Install Python `>=3.10`, pip, and Git (or an IDE that provides these).
2. Fork and git clone this repository to your development machine (do not just download the source zip!!).
3. Set up the `venv` for Python (from repo directory in PowerShell or IDE terminal).
   1. `python -m venv .\venv\`
   2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. In future, activate the `venv` in PowerShell with `<repo_path>\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
